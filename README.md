### Minicraft Potato Edition
A demake of Minicraft that uses ASCII characters instead of sprites and features infinite terrain generation. This project is developed in Python using `pygame-ce` (Pygame Community Edition).

The original Minicraft was created by Markus Persson (Notch) in Java for the Ludum Dare 22 competition. This implementation is inspired by Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft, bringing the classic Minicraft experience to a new level with a focus on visual simplicity and endless exploration.

**Currently this project is in full development, so it is no surprise that the code is not a big deal :(**
